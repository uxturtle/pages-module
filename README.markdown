# Pages Module

This is a simple module for [Kohana PHP](http://kohanaphp.com) (an awesome PHP5 framework) for building the HTML `<head>` quickly, and easily. Pages also provides a simple approach to templating, more reuseable views, and script combining and caching.

Documentation is still lacking, but I hope to get it done soon. We have started on it though. Check out the [wiki](http://wiki.github.com/samsoffes/pages-module) for more information.

If you have any questions or start using the Pages module, please email [Sam Soffes](mailto:sam@samsoff.es) or [Josh Turmel](mailto:jturmel@gmail.com).

You should probably take a look at the other forks since, we generally don't work on new functionality here.
